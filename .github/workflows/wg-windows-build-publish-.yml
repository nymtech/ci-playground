# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on 
    # remove windows11 tag for real runner
    runs-on: [self-hosted, Windows, windows11, noroot]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # This part here is cloning a second repository
    # While cloning the repository:
    #   - it clones the repo into the given `path`
    #   - it checks out the branch defined at `ref`
